\section{Introduction}

This document describes the working details of the main memory and the main bus of the Computer~Architecture course computer.

\subsection{Bus}
Main bus is 16~bit wide address and 32~bit wide data bus.

\subsection{\memoryname{}}
\memoryname{} is a SDR DRAM, single data rate dynamic random access memory.

It can hold a total amount of 512~Kbit (64~KiB) of data, and can be accessed as 16~K locations of 32~bit (4 B) each.

\section{Main computer bus}
Physical main bus of \computername{} presents the following wires.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\begin{tikzpicture}
  % data wires
  \draw (0, 1)--(10, 1);
  \node at (5, 1){};
  \node [draw, strike out] at (5, 1){};
  \node [above] at (5, 1){32};
  \node [right] at (10, 1){\texttt{data}};

  % address wires
  \draw (0, 2)--(10, 2);
  \node at (5, 2){};
  \node [draw, strike out] at (5, 2){};
  \node [above] at (5, 2){16};
  \node [right] at (10, 2){\texttt{address}};

  % mw
  \draw (0, 3)--(10, 3);
  \node [right] at (10, 3){\textoverline{\texttt{mw}}};
  % mr
  \draw (0, 3.5)--(10, 3.5);
  \node [right] at (10, 3.5){\textoverline{\texttt{mr}}};

  % busy wire
  \draw (0, 4)--(10, 4);
  \node [right] at (10, 4){\texttt{busy}};
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{main bus of \computername{}}
\end{figure}

% explanation
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{busy:} this wire represents the busy status of the bus; the busy wire is active high.
  \item \textbf{\textoverline{mr}:} this wire issues a read data command, and instructs a module to put data from its internal structures onto the bus; the \textoverline{mr} wire is active low;
  \item \textbf{\textoverline{mw}:} this wire issues a write data command, and instructs a module to retrieve data from the bus and put into its internal structures; the \textoverline{mw} wire is active low;
  \item \textbf{address:} is 16~wires wide and selects the address from which/to which data must be read/written;
  \item \textbf{data:} is 32~wires wide and holds the actual data that must be read or written;
\end{itemize}

Thus, main computer bus can be represented in the simulation software by means of the following global \texttt{Bus} structure.

\begin{verbatim}
struct Bus {
  bool busy;
  bool _mr, _mw;
  uint16_t address;
  uint32_t data;
}
\end{verbatim}

% BHA Protocol
\subsection{Bus handshake protocol}
In the simulation software, modules can:
\begin{itemize}
  \item be idle: this corresponds to the high impedance physical state;
  \item perform a read action from the bus;
  \item perform a write action on the bus;
\end{itemize}

Actions on bus must be performed in the simulation using the following protocol.

\begin{itemize}
  \item being idle: \texttt{bus} structure must not be read or written;
  \item read data: data can be read only upon receiving a message from another module.
  When data has been read from the global \texttt{bus} structure into local structures, bus busy bit must be clear to terminate the handshake.
  \item write data: when a module wants to occupy the bus for writing data, first it must ensure that bus is free by checking the busy wire status.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item if busy bit is 0, data can be written onto the bus and bus busy bit must be set; moreover, destination module must be notified of the bus change by sending it a message using methods provided by the orchestrator.
    For the sake of simplicity, message passed through the orchestrator can be tought as a model for the hardware \emph{enable} wire;
    \item if busy bit is 1, data must not be written onto the bus, and module must wait for the next quantum of time (\emph{tick});
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Please note that this does not model the actual hardware behavior, since a reading module can not clear a set bit on the bus; but since it is not necessary to perfectly reproduce the hardware behavior, this handshake is used in order to simplify the simulation software.

Note: since simulation is sequential and modules are always notified in the same order, concurrency is not actually modeled, and some modules can suffer from starvation.

% thus, a proper read/write operation can be represented in time like the following timing diagram:
% busy
% mr
% mw
% address
% data
% (be careful and remember to represent both the read and the write operation examples)

\section{Transfer speed}
Since this is a \emph{single data rate} memory, in short SDR, it is theoretically possible to read or write data from/to the memory once for every rising edge of the bus clock.

Thus, maximum theoretical transfer speed is given by the following formula:

$$ s_{max} =  f \cdot B_w $$
